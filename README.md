# 🧠 Lucid — Personal Data Bank

**Version:** 0.1 (MVP Phase)
**Author:** Terron Hyde
**License:** MIT (open-source)
**Status:** In Development

---

## 🌐 Overview

**Lucid** is a privacy-first **personal data bank** — a secure vault where individuals can store, manage, and license access to their personal data under explicit consent.

Lucid treats data as **property**, not a **product**.

> Individuals can securely store and license access to their digital data — without ever surrendering ownership.

### Core Philosophy

- **User Sovereignty**: Users remain the sole custodians of their data
- **Transparency by Default**: Every access and transaction is recorded and auditable
- **Portability through Open Standards**: Data conforms to universal formats for interoperability

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

### The Problem
The global digital economy runs on personal data — yet individuals who generate it have neither control nor compensation. Current data practices are opaque and exploitative.

### The Solution
Lucid enables a fundamental shift: transforming personal data from a harvested resource into a **governed, portable, and monetizable asset class** under full user control.

### Target Ecosystem

**Data Owners (Individuals)**
- Privacy advocates seeking transparency
- Professionals needing verifiable credential storage
- Anyone wanting control over their digital identity

**Data Consumers (Organizations)**
- Research institutions requiring consented participant data
- Healthcare providers needing compliant medical records
- Financial institutions demanding verified data
- Employers validating credentials

---

## 🎯 MVP Goals

The MVP aims to prove one foundational truth: **personal data can be licensed securely and transparently without surrendering ownership.**

### Must Have Features

✅ **Encrypted Personal Data Vault**
Secure storage with AES-256 encryption, user-controlled keys

✅ **Consent-Based Access Control**
Granular permissions defining who can access what data, for how long

✅ **Immutable Audit Ledger**
Hash-chained transparency log of all data access events

✅ **Data Portability**
Export to open standards (JSON-LD, Verifiable Credentials)

✅ **Intuitive User Experience**
Banking metaphor: "Your data. Your bank. Your rules."

### Deferred to Beta

- Payment integration (Stripe Connect)
- Multiple data schemas (FHIR, Open Banking APIs)
- Advanced Verifiable Credentials
- Mobile applications
- Buyer marketplace

## ✨ Features

### Consent Management System

The Lucid MVP includes a comprehensive consent management system that allows users to grant organizations granular access to their vault data with full transparency and control.

#### Core Capabilities

- **Granular Permission Control**: Grant consent for specific vault entries or general access to all data
- **Three Access Levels**:
  - **Read**: View-only access to data
  - **Export**: Download and export data capabilities
  - **Verify**: Authenticate and verify data authenticity
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Flexible expiration with presets (30/90/365 days) or indefinite duration
- **Full Revocation**: Revoke consent at any time with mandatory reason tracking
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time consent status (Active, Expired, or Revoked)
- **Audit Trail Integration**: All consent actions logged to immutable audit ledger

#### Components

- **ConsentList** - Dashboard with search, filtering by status/organization, and real-time status indicators
- **ConsentCreateDialog** - Interactive form to grant new consent with organization details, access level selection, purpose declaration, and expiration presets
- **ConsentViewDialog** - Detailed consent view showing access details, timeline, legal/compliance information, and action buttons
- **ConsentExtendDialog** - Update consent expiration dates with quick preset options
- **ConsentRevokeDialog** - Revoke consent with mandatory reason and confirmation

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/consent` - List user consents with optional filters (vaultDataId, active status)
- `POST /api/consent` - Create new consent with validation and audit logging
- `GET /api/consent/[id]` - Get specific consent details
- `PATCH /api/consent/[id]` - Extend consent expiration date
- `DELETE /api/consent/[id]` - Revoke consent with reason

#### Data Model

The consent system uses a robust data model with the following key fields:
- User and organization identifiers (userId, grantedTo, grantedToName)
- Optional vault data linkage (vaultDataId) for specific data sharing
- Access control (accessLevel, purpose)
- Temporal tracking (startDate, endDate, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Revocation management (revoked, revokedAt, revokedReason)
- Compliance metadata (ipAddress, userAgent, termsVersion)

All consent actions are automatically logged to the immutable audit trail for full transparency and compliance.

## 🔒 Security

### Encryption Strategy
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption via pgcrypto (PostgreSQL)
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3
- **Key Management**: User-derived keys with optional recovery
- **Field-level**: Sensitive data encrypted before storage

### Privacy by Design
- Opt-in sharing only (no data collection without consent)
- Consent and audit systems integrated into core architecture
- Privacy protection coexists with functionality
- Right to portability and deletion built-in

### Compliance
- **GDPR**: Right to access, portability, erasure
- **CCPA**: "Do Not Sell" mechanisms, data transparency
- **HIPAA**: Encrypted medical data storage (Phase 3)

## 🎯 Why TypeScript (Not Go)?

After evaluating both languages, **TypeScript** was chosen because:

✅ **Better for learning** - Great IDE support, type checking catches errors
✅ **Perfect for UX iteration** - Rapid frontend development with hot reload
✅ **Seamless integration** - Works perfectly with Supabase and Vercel
✅ **Single language** - No context switching between frontend/backend
✅ **Massive ecosystem** - Extensive community support and libraries

**Go consideration**: While Go offers excellent performance and concurrency, it would add unnecessary complexity for MVP development. Performance-critical services can migrate to Go in later phases if needed.

## 🌟 Vision

Lucid's long-term vision is to become a **foundational layer of ethical digital infrastructure**, transforming personal data from a harvested resource into a governed, portable, and monetizable asset class under full user control.

**The key principle**: *Data as property, not product.*

---

**Built with privacy, transparency, and user empowerment at the core.**

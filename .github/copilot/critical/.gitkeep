# Critical Patterns (Always Referenced)

This directory contains documentation for patterns that are essential for every feature implementation:
- Security patterns (encryption, authentication, audit logging)
- API route patterns (standard structure, error handling)
- Database schema reference (Prisma models, relationships)

These files should be consulted before implementing any feature that involves:
- User data access or storage
- Authentication/authorization
- Sensitive operations requiring audit trails

# Reference Documentation (Occasionally Referenced)

This directory contains reference material that doesn't change frequently:
- Coding conventions (naming, imports, file organization)
- Tech stack reference (libraries, versions, configuration)
- Development workflow (commands, URLs - with links to QUICKSTART.md)

These files are useful for onboarding and looking up specific details.
